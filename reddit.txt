# Project Navex

Hello fellow NSFs & NSmen combatants!

I'm sure many of you guys have felt the pain of preparing your NDS right before a navigation exercise or mission. Measuring the MGR and azimuth over and over again and wasting time that could be spent preparing or simply resting in bunk for a little more before the outfield.

Fret not, because over the last (and final hehe) 2 months, my friend and I have been working on an Navigation Data Sheet (NDS) generator program and it is finally ready for release on [projectnavex.com](https://projectnavex.com)!

**How to use:**

The tool is very straightforward and easy to use!

1. Place all the checkpoints on the map itself or enter the MGRs manually. The placed markers are movable and you can also remove them.
2. Select the intervals you want between each subpoint. 100m for day, 50m for night.
3. Hit run and the NDS table is generated below!

Do keep in mind that currently, the tool only creates straight lines between checkpoints so you may need to add another point to avoid buildings or water bodies.

***Water detection and auto rerouting is in the works so stay tuned for that :p***
